# Advanced Python Programming Course

This repository contains the complete course materials for **Advanced Python Programming** under the guidance of **Dr. Eskandari**. The course covers a wide range of topics essential for mastering Python and developing real-world applications.

The course is designed for advanced learners, aiming to enhance their knowledge of Python through practical lessons, in-depth explanations, and hands-on coding exercises. Each topic is well-structured with accompanying code examples and explanations to provide a solid understanding.

## Course Structure

### 1. Introduction to Python
This section introduces Python programming to students who have basic familiarity with programming. It covers:
- Python installation and setup
- Basic syntax and structure
- Data types and variables
- Input/output operations
- Comments and indentation

### 2. Control Flow
Control flow helps manage the order of execution in a Python program. This section covers:
- If-else statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Nested conditions
- Break, continue, and pass statements
- Practical examples of control flow in Python

### 3. Data Structures
In this section, we dive into Python’s built-in data structures, including:
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Understanding the use of data structures for performance and memory optimization

### 4. Functions
Functions are the core of reusable and modular code in Python. This section includes:
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments and return values
- Lambda functions
- Recursion
- Understanding variable scope
- Practical examples of writing and using functions effectively

### 5. File Handling
This section teaches how to work with files in Python, covering:
- Reading and writing files
- Working with file paths
- Handling exceptions in file operations
- File management using context managers (`with` statement)

### 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is essential for building large and maintainable Python applications. This section covers:
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Method overriding and overloading
- Understanding OOP principles through real-world examples

### 7. Modules and Libraries
This section focuses on using Python’s extensive libraries and creating modular code:
- Creating and importing modules
- Standard libraries in Python (e.g., `math`, `datetime`, `os`)
- Installing third-party libraries using `pip`
- Writing your own modules for reuse in different projects

### 8. Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex) are used for pattern matching in text. This section covers:
- Basic syntax of regex
- Using Python’s `re` module
- Search, match, and substitution functions
- Practical examples of parsing and extracting data using regex
